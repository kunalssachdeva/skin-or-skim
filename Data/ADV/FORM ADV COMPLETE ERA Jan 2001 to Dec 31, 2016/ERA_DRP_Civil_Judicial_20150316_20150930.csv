JACKSON MOVED TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2011.  THE COMPLAINT WAS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION ON JANUARY 11, 2012 AND PLAINTIFFS WERE GRANTED LEAVE TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT.    ON FEBRUARY 20, 2012, NMSIC FILED A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. JACKSON, VARIOUS INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND OTHERS IN THE FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO.  THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT TO VARYING DEGREES, THE DEFENDANTS MISREPRESENTED THEIR LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION IN CONNECTION WITH SOLICITING INVESTMENTS FROM THE NMSIC.  CAPITAL POINT PARTNERS, LP (""CPP"") WAS NOT NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN THE NMSIC ACTION, AND THE COMPLAINT MADE NO ALLEGATIONS NMSIC INVESTMENTS IN, CPP OR ITS FUNDS WERE IMPROPER OR WERE MISMANAGED.  MR. JACKSON DENIED, AND CONTINUES TO DENY, ANY WRONGDOING IN CONNECTION WITH THE NMSIC ACTION.  RATHER THAN ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION, MR. JACKSON AGREED TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE WITH NMSIC AND ALSO PARTICIPATED IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT RESULTED IN A SETTLEMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL NMSIC CLAIMS AGAINST CPP.  JACKSON SETTLED WITH NMSIC IN NOVEMBER 2014.  THE SETTLEMENT CONSTITUTED A COMPROMISE OF DISPUTED CLAIMS, AND A MOTION FOR MR. JACKSON'S VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL WAS FILED BY NMSIC ON NOVEMBER 13, 2014.  IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION, NMSIC CITED MR. JACKSON'S COOPERATION AND PROVISION OF EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO NMSIC IN PROSECUTING ITS CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER DEFENDANTS.   A HEARING WAS HELD ON JANUARY 7, 2015 TO ASSESS THE FAIRNESS, ADEQUACY AND REASONABLENESS OF THE PROPOSED JACKSON SETTLEMENT AND VOLUNTARY MOTION TO DISMISS.  THE COURT HEARD ARGUMENT FROM BOTH PLAINTIFF'S AND MR. JACKSON'S COUNSEL IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION, AND EVALUATED FACTS AND OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED TO THE COURT BY MR. JACKSON AND BY NMSIC.  THE COURT DETERMINED THAT THE PROPOSED JACKSON SETTLEMENT WAS FAIR, ADEQUATE AND REASONABLE AND IT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT AND GRANTED THE MOTION TO DISMISS.  TO DATE, NMSIC REMAINS AN INVESTED LIMITED PARTNER IN CPP AND HAS RECEIVED FAVORABLE RETURNS ON ITS INVESTMENTS."
