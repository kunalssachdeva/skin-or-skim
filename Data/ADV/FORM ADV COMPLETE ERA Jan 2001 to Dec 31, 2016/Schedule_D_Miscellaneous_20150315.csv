THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT ADVISER TO THE HEDGECO FUND, HEDGECO HYBRID MASTER GP, LLC (THE ""HEDGECO INVESTMENT ADVISER"") HAS, THROUGH COUNSEL, INFORMED ROCKMORE THAT THE HEDGECO INVESTMENT ADVISER DOES NOT INTEND TO FILE A FORM ADV DUE TO THE HEDGECO INVESTMENT ADVISER HAVING FEWER THAN $25 MILLION REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.  (Update, February 8, 2013) Rockmore is filing this other-than-annual amendment in response to direction by the Commission that Rockmore report the HedgeCo Fund on Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. As disclosed in the initial filing, Rockmore acted solely as a subadvisor to the HedgeCo Fund. (Rockmore ended its subadvisory relationship with the HedgeCo Fund in May, 2012.) As a subadvisor, Rockmore lacked the capability to respond to most of the items in Section 7.B.(1). In a letter dated February 4, 2013 (the HedgeCo Letter) and updated on February 7, 2013 (the ""Updated Letter""), the HedgeCo Investment Adviser provided Rockmore with responses to items 1  28 of Section 7.B.(1). Except for items 17, 19, 20, 26(d), and 28(b), which request information specifically from Rockmore, the responses provided are those provided by the HedgeCo Investment Adviser in the HedgeCo Letter and the Updated Letter.  In responding to the items of Section 7.B.(1) for the HedgeCo Fund, Rockmore is relying on the representations made by the HedgeCo Investment Adviser in the HedgeCo Letter and the Updated Letter. In the Updated Letter, the HedgeCo Investment Adviser represented to Rockmore that the responses therein ""contain no untrue statement of material fact, nor omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading."" Such representation does not extend to items 6(b) and 7 of Section 7.B.(1), responses to which the HedgeCo Investment Adviser withdrew from the Updated Letter.   Rockmore is not able to provide independent verification of the representations made by the HedgeCo Investment Adviser in the HedgeCo Letter and the Updated Letter.   Accordingly, Rockmore makes no claims regarding the material accuracy or completeness of the responses provided in the HedgeCo Letter, the Updated Letter, or, as a result, on Section 7.B.(1) (and in particular, items 6(b) and 7 thereof) for the HedgeCo Fund.  The HedgeCo Investment Adviser has declined to disclose the identity of other subadvisors to the HedgeCo Fund, as is requested by item 18(b) of Section 7.(B).(1). Therefore, Rockmore is unable to submit a response to that item.  As a result of reporting the HedgeCo Fund on Section 7.B.(1), Rockmore has removed its reporting of the HedgeCo Fund on Section 7.B.(2)."

THE PURPOSE OF PARTNERS GROUP'S INDEPENDENT VALUATION PROCESS IS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT.  PURSUANT TO INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS ""THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH AN ASSET COULD BE EXCHANGED, OR A LIABILITY SETTLED, BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, WILLING PARTIES IN AN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION"". THE NEED FOR SUCH PROCESS ARISES BECAUSE PRIVATE MARKETS PARTNERSHIPS MAY FOLLOW DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND/OR VALUATION GUIDELINES (E.G. IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP, INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL VALUATION GUIDELINES (IPEV), AND OTHERS).  AS A RESULT, THE NAVS REPORTED BY AN INVESTMENT PARTNER ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT MADE BY A PRIVATE FUND MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE ""FAIR VALUE.""   FURTHERMORE, THERE IS OFTEN A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE REPORTING DATE AND THE LATEST AVAILABLE INVESTMENT PARTNER REPORT.  PARTNERS GROUP'S INDEPENDENT VALUATION REVIEW THUS AIMS TO VERIFY AND IF NECESSARY, ADJUST THE UNDERLYING REPORTED NAVS AS STATED IN AN INVESTMENT PARTNER REPORT.

PARTNERS GROUP AG TOGETHER WITH EACH RELYING ERA ARE COMPLETING A SINGLE FORM ADV BASED UPON AN INTERPRETATION OF THE SEC STAFF'S POSITION EXPRESSED IN THE 2012 ABA NO ACTION LETTER.   WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVATE FUNDS LISTED IN ITEM 7(B) THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED AS BEING ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ARE SCOTTISH LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS GOVERNED BY SCOTTISH LAW; AS THE FORM DOES NOT PERMIT SCOTLAND TO BE LISTED AS A JURISDICTION, UNITED KINGDOM IS CHOSEN INSTEAD.  WITH RESPECT TO ITEM 11, THE FILING ERA AND EACH RELYING ERA HAS DISCUSSED INTERNALLY AND CONSULTED THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY AND TO THE BEST KNOWLEDGE OF THE FILING ERA AND EACH RELYING ERA, HAS PROVIDED THE RESPONSES CONTAINED IN ITEM 11.  WITH RESPECT TO RESPONSE FOR QUESTION 27 UNDER ITEM 7B (1) BEING O%, THIS MARKS A CHANGE FROM THE RESPONSE ON FORM ADV IN 2012 OF 100%. IN A 2013 REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO RESPOND TO QUESTION 27 WITH A DISCLOSURE OF 0% AS EACH RELYING ERA MAY DETERMINE VALUATIONS OR ADJUST VALUATIONS PROVIDED BY EXTERNAL SOURCES. SPECIFICALLY, PARTNERS GROUP PERFORMS INDEPENDENT VALUATIONS OF ITS UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS THROUGH A FAIR MARKET VALUATION PROCESS, WHICH IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) AND UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (US GAAP).  THIS PROCESS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 2003 AND HAS BEEN HAS BEEN REFINED BASED ON FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS (PWC), THE AUDITOR OF THE PRIVATE FUNDS IDENTIFIED IN SECTION 7B (1).  ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE MONITORING AND VALUATION PROCESS BASED ON FAIR VALUATION PRINCIPLES (SAMPLE SELECTION, VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, ETC.) IS DISCUSSED AND APPROVED BY THE AUDITORS OF SUCH PRIVATE FUNDS MANAGED BY PARTNERS GROUP. PARTNERS GROUP COMPLIES WITH THE DEFINED PROCESS AND APPLIES IT AS THE BASIS FOR THE YEAR-END VALUATION AND SUBSEQUENT QUARTERLY NAV DETERMINATIONS OF THE PRIVATE FUNDS MANAGED BY THE FIRM.  THE PURPOSE OF PARTNERS GROUP'S INDEPENDENT VALUATION PROCESS IS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT.  PURSUANT TO INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS ""THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH AN ASSET COULD BE EXCHANGED, OR A LIABILITY SETTLED, BETWEEN KNOWLEDGEABLE, WILLING PARTIES IN AN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION"". THE NEED FOR SUCH PROCESS ARISES BECAUSE PRIVATE MARKETS PARTNERSHIPS MAY FOLLOW DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND/OR VALUATION GUIDELINES (E.G. IFRS, US GAAP, UK GAAP, INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL VALUATION GUIDELINES (IPEV), AND OTHERS).  AS A RESULT, THE NAVS REPORTED BY AN INVESTMENT PARTNER ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT MADE BY A PRIVATE FUND MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE ""FAIR VALUE.""   FURTHERMORE, THERE IS OFTEN A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE REPORTING DATE AND THE LATEST AVAILABLE INVESTMENT PARTNER REPORT.  PARTNERS GROUP'S INDEPENDENT VALUATION REVIEW THUS AIMS TO VERIFY AND IF NECESSARY, ADJUST THE UNDERLYING REPORTED NAVS AS STATED IN AN INVESTMENT PARTNER REPORT.  PARTNERS GROUP GATHERS THE VALUATION-RELEVANT INFORMATION BY SYSTEMATICALLY SCREENING A BROAD SET OF SOURCES FOR VALUATION-RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT PORTFOLIO COMPANIES WHICH ARE HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY PARTNERS GROUP'S PRIVATE FUNDS. THIS INCLUDES INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE FIRM'S DUE DILIGENCE AND MONITORING PROFESSIONALS, UNDERLYING FUND MANAGERS AND INFORMATION PUBLISHED IN INDUSTRY JOURNALS AND/OR OTHER PUBLICATIONS."

In addition, because in order to submit this filing we are required to answer Question #4 of Section 7.B(1) of Schedule D for each such entity, we selected choice (2) for reliance on section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, even though, as mentioned above in this Miscellaneous section, such entities rely on an investment company exclusion under the 1940 Act other than section 3(c)(1) and section 3(c)(7).  In answering Question #12 of Section 7.B(1) of Schedule D for each such entity, we inserted $0 because there is no required minimum investment for such entities; rather, the applicable investment commitment is negotiated on a case-by-case basis with each investor."

This is because 1914 Advisors is the investment advisor affiliate of Boenning & Scattergood, Inc., a broker-dealer, and that they both have the same CRD number of 100.  The system recognizes that CRD number 100 belongs to 1914 Advisors and automatically changes the answers for the name of the marketer and the SEC file number.

The SFC did not find that either Oasis Management (Hong Kong) LLC or Mr. Fischer had breached any law or regulation in respect of their actions, and took into account that Oasis Management (Hong Kong) LLC and Mr. Fischer had voluntarily taken steps, in 2007, not required by law or regulation, to reduce any similar concerns arising from their trading by imposing internal guidelines in relation to their trading in connection with all secondary offerings on the TSE.  Oasis Management (Hong Kong) LLC and Mr. Fischer remain licensed in good standing with the SFC with no limitations or restrictions on their ability to conduct regulated activities in Hong Kong or to trade on the TSE.  No Oasis fund investor bore any portion of the fine paid by Oasis Management (Hong Kong) LLC or Mr. Fischer.  Further details can be found at www.sfc.hk."
