UNDER BRAZILIAN LAW, A REAL ESTATE FUND MUST BE ADMINISTERED BY A DULY REGISTERED ENTITY WITH CERTAIN BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES AND, AS A RESULT, THE THREE INVESTORS RETAINED MERCURIO S.A.

GIVEN THESE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND WAS CONTROLLED BY THE THREE INVESTORS AND MERCURIO WOULD ACT ON THEIR BEHALF AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THEN IN EFFECT.

AS A RESPONSE, THE CVM INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FUND AND FORMALLY CHARGED RIO BRAVO AND LUIZ, AS DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 7 ABOVE.  CONSIDERING THAT CERTAIN OF THE ALLEGATIONS REFERRED TO ACTIONS THAT PRECEDED THE TRANSFER OF MERCURIO, RIO BRAVO DECIDED TO PROPOSE A SETTLEMENT TO THE CVM IN ORDER TO AVOID LITIGATION OVER THESE MATTERS WITHOUT ASSUMING ANY TYPE OF FAULT IN CONNECTION WITH CVM'S CLAIMS (AS PERMITTED UNDER BRAZILIAN LAW).  ON AUGUST 8, 2011, RIO BRAVO AND CVM EXECUTED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND, ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2011, RIO BRAVO PAID A MONETARY FINE OF R$96,614.41 (OR APPROXIMATELY US$56,832.01) TO CVM AND DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF R$132,968.97 (OR APPROXIMATELY US$78,217.04) TO ONE OF THE INVESTORS OF THE FUND.

GAP RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS THAT CAN RESULT IF THE PRESENT VALUE OF A TRADE FALLS BELOW THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL FOR THE TRADE POSTED BY THE COUNTERPARTY. DURING THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE, DBAG DID NOT ADJUST ITS VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES TO ACCOUNT FOR GAP RISK, ESSENTIALLY ASSIGNING A ZERO VALUE FOR GAP RISK. THE SEC FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO STANDARD INDUSTRY MODEL TO VALUE GAP RISK AND THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS COMPLEX, DBAG DID NOT REASONABLY ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES FOR GAP RISK DURING THESE PERIODS, RESULTING IN MISSTATEMENTS OF ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE. THE SEC ALSO FOUND THAT DBAG FAILED TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS OVER THE VALUATION PROCESS. THE SEC FOUND VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 13(A) (REQUIREMENT TO FILE ACCURATE PERIODIC REPORTS WITH THE SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE BOOKS AND RECORDS), AND 13(B)(2)(B)(REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE INTERNAL  ACCOUNTING CONTROLS).

GAP RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS THAT CAN RESULT IF THE PRESENT VALUE OF A TRADE FALLS BELOW THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL FOR THE TRADE POSTED BY THE COUNTERPARTY. DURING THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE, DBAG DID NOT ADJUST ITS VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES TO ACCOUNT FOR GAP RISK, ESSENTIALLY ASSIGNING A ZERO VALUE FOR GAP RISK. THE SEC FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO STANDARD INDUSTRY MODEL TO VALUE GAP RISK AND THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS COMPLEX, DBAG DID NOT REASONABLY ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES FOR GAP RISK DURING THESE PERIODS, RESULTING IN MISSTATEMENTS OF ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE. THE SEC ALSO FOUND THAT DBAG FAILED TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS OVER THE VALUATION PROCESS. THE SEC FOUND VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 13(A) (REQUIREMENT TO FILE ACCURATE PERIODIC REPORTS WITH THE SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE BOOKS AND RECORDS), AND 13(B)(2)(B)(REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE INTERNAL  ACCOUNTING CONTROLS).
