GAP RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS THAT CAN RESULT IF THE PRESENT VALUE OF A TRADE FALLS BELOW THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL FOR THE TRADE POSTED BY THE COUNTERPARTY. DURING THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE, DBAG DID NOT ADJUST ITS VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES TO ACCOUNT FOR GAP RISK, ESSENTIALLY ASSIGNING A ZERO VALUE FOR GAP RISK. THE SEC FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO STANDARD INDUSTRY MODEL TO VALUE GAP RISK AND THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS COMPLEX, DBAG DID NOT REASONABLY ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES FOR GAP RISK DURING THESE PERIODS, RESULTING IN MISSTATEMENTS OF ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE. THE SEC ALSO FOUND THAT DBAG FAILED TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS OVER THE VALUATION PROCESS.
